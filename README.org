#+TITLE: Git hooks

Custom git hooks for various setups, mainly to prevent myself from pushing unnoticed inconsistencies to a branch.

* Usage

  Clone this repo into the root of the repository that you want to apply the hooks to: ~git clone https://github.com/0-l/git-hooks && cd git-hooks/~

  This repo contains a script to quickly move the specified hooks into the .git/hooks folder: ~./set-hook <folder>~

  Where =folder= is the name of the folder containing the hooks (eg. ~./set-hook angular~).

  ~.set-hook~ will also remove ~git-hooks/~ from the list of untracked files.

* Hooks provided

  For now, only these:

  | Name    | hooks                                 |
  |---------+---------------------------------------|
  | angular | =pre-push= =pre-commit= =post-commit= |
