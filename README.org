#+TITLE: Git hooks

(WIP) Custom git hooks for various setups, mainly to prevent myself from pushing unnoticed inconsistencies to a branch.

* Usage

  This repo contains a script to quickly move the specified hooks into the .git/hooks folder: ~./set-hook <folder>~

  Where =folder= is the name of the folder containing the hooks (eg. ~./set-hook angular~).

* Hooks provided

  For now, only these:

  | Name    | hooks                   |
  |---------+-------------------------|
  | angular | =pre-push= =pre-commit= |
  | react   | ###                     |
  | node    | ###                     |
  | node/TS | ###                     |
  | ruby    | ###                     |
